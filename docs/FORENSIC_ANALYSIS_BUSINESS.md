## Executive Summary

CredoPass addresses a **genuine market gap** in the event management space. While ticketing platforms like EventBrite, Meetup, and Eventix focus on ticket sales and RSVPs, **none provide granular attendance tracking** with check-in/check-out times and analytics. This creates a compelling value proposition for organizations that prioritize attendance data over ticket revenue.

### Business Viability Verdict: STRONG ✅

|--------|-------|------------|
| Market Opportunity | 90/100 | Large underserved market |
| Competitive Position | 85/100 | Clear differentiation |
| Monetization Potential | 90/100 | Multiple revenue streams |
| Scalability | 75/100 | Good tech foundation |
| Time to Market | 50/100 | 6-8 weeks to MVP |
| Investment Required | Moderate | $20K-40K to production |
